GOALS OF PROJECT: 
- Make site fluidly responsive across all breakpoints
- Establish a cohesive visual design system that works across all 3 articles and a home page “binding” them together
- Follow best typography practices learned throughout the semester (gutters, padding, hierarchy, size, color-contrast etc.)
- Incorporate 1 image and inline svg

WHAT I COMPLETED:
- Grid a border pattern to apply across all h1s to mimic a stained-glass window motif
- Ensured fluid responsiveness across all breakpoints (centered —> left-aligned —> 2 column screen left-aligned) (main breakpoints: 750px, 1050px, 1400px)
- Styled for light/dark mode
- Added slight light glass shimmer animation only on refresh (included prefers-reduced-motion)
- Added image as background texture to mimic glass
- Included inline svg as home logo and summary marker
- Made nav bar responsive (hamburger then expand to nav bar when width >= 1050px)
- Edited down articles to manageable lengths, selected/styled blockquotes,  article links 
- Ensured accessible color-contrast against black text for colored panels 
- Made all colors, fonts, spacing, sizes variables references throughout the pages
- Consolidate most styling to common.css, minimal individual css page styling
- Included intro/colophon explaining context of site

MAIN TRIUMPHS:
- Creating fluid responsiveness with breakpoints 
- Styling a border pattern grid with multiple spans
- Grid div's expanding to different grid squares when clicked on
- Styling h1 with the window borders without sacrificing too much gutter space (especially on mobile)
- Figuring out the breakpoint rules of when certain fonts/padding/alignments should respond
- Hamburger menu drop-down nav bar that expands to a sticky nav bar at a larger breakpoint
- Pulling back on design and really focusing on typography this time (this was specifically feedback I got on the last project of "keeping it too long in the oven," so I wanted to not overdue it and keep it pretty minimal on super dynamic visual elements to focus on the styling, sizing, spacing, responsiveness, etc. of the actual body text
- Starting mobile first!! (hate to admit it, but this really was so much easier building up)
- I finally fully leaned into nesting!! (love, love, LOVE it-- really does make things so much easier, breaks sections up almost like components in Figma is how I saw it)

MAIN CHALLENGERS:
- The hardest challenge was identifying a single visual design language that could unify all three readings while still giving each one enough flexibility to feel distinct.
- I spent most of the time experimenting and iterating, continually adjusting what conceptual element could tie the pieces together.
- After Michael’s feedback that he missed the “oomph” of the original saturated-color sketches, I realized my gradient motif wasn’t delivering the same impact and created accessibility issues.
- I pivoted to a stained-glass-window concept instead of gradient boxes, which let me keep the overall structure of the visual elements while introducing more vibrant, impactful colors.
- Making it fluidly responsive especially with the border pattern and the large h1 in spans so it couldn't act as a normal inline wrap text
- Ensuring accessibility with the brighter colors against black body text
- Figuring out the balance and pushing the limit of what I could tinker with to serve my window design vs. adhering to best type/UI practices
- Consolidating as much as I could do the common.css and figuring out exactly what needed to be separated

WHAT I WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK ON (TIME/SKILL PERMITTED):
- Styling print mode (especially considering the brighter colors and box-shadows using excessive ink)
- Adding more subtle animations/interactions regarding light to play up the window motif (maybe have a sunbeam sweep across the page?)
- Incorporate a more detailed window aesthetic with potentially bevels as corners
- Perhaps create a whole design/illustration on the home page that really mimics a full window stain brick wall like in a traditional gothic church
- Couldn't figure out how to keep details open on mobile but closed when width >= a certain breakpoint without using java 

QUESTIONS I STILL HAVE: 
- How can I take this one step further? How does my visual language limit how much I can expand on the visual design? How much further can I push the window motif?
- What’s another way I could’ve incorporate an image? An SVG?
- Is two-column view on larger screens even most effective?
- How can I make this the most accessible? How would screen readers read the broken up h1s properly?
